            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is but one God, the Father; of whom are all things; <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.35. &amp; 6.4.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He is not only the Author of all Beings, but alſo the Fountain of all Good; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. And all his Wayes, which contain both his Decrees or Purpoſes, and his Works, are all like himſelf, very good; <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13, 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.4, 5.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But how can it be clearly proved that there is a God beyond doubt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The Works of God make it evident; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. See more of this in my Book, called <hi>A Preſervative from Atheiſm and Error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But if God did make all things very good, how came Mankind ſo very bad?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. By breaking the Law and Covenant of God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is the Law and Covenant all one?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. There is no difference, but only this; the conditions of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the breaker of the Law, and bleſſing the doer of it, expreſt <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 12. annexed or added to the Law, maketh it a Covenant.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What Law do you mean?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The ten Commandments, expreſt <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How doth it appear that this Law was given from the beginning, and that Man tranſgreſt it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. In that it is called the old and firſt Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20. in that it ſtops every mouth, and lays
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34625:4"/>all the World under guilt, and brings them to the knowledge of ſin. See more of this in the fore-mentioned Book.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the puniſhment due for the breach of this Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The Curſe of God; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Did the Curſe fall upon Mankind immediatly upon the firſt ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yea, in part it did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet not in full meaſure, to the utter ruin of the World, as in God's juſt ſeverity it might have done.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How came the World to have any mercy and patience extended to it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The Lord did graciouſly pre-ordain a Mediator to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Himſelf and Man, who did undertake to die for Man, and ſo ſtay the Curſe from falling upon him, to his immediate and utter ruin; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Do you judge</hi> Adams <hi>eating the forbidden fruit was a ſin againſt the ten Commandments, ſeeing it is judged by ſome that they were not given till they were made known at</hi> Sinai?</p>
            <p>A. It is evident he ſinned againſt that Law, breaking the firſt, fifth, ſixth, eighth, ninth, tenth, in the very letter of them. And that his ſin was againſt this Covenant is further manifeſt, thus: Till the firſt Covenant was faulty, there ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſecond, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7. For the Law is not faulty in it ſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12, 13. but its only fault was, it would not ſave, nor any way help us when once it was broken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10. &amp; 8.3, 4. Now the breach of this Law leaving us helpleſs; for it could give no life, when once life was forfeited, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. therefore all life and mercy ſince the Fall muſt come by Chriſt upon a New-Covenant-account, no other way being left now to attain it. But further; this is clear from this conſideration, That by the deeds of the Law can no fleſh be juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20, 28. and yet Juſtification <hi>Abel</hi> obtained upon a New-Covenant-account at that day: for he was juſtified by Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. and Faith hath no relation to the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. but they that are made juſt by Faith, it is by Grace, through Redemption-mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, quite through to the end of the 5th chapter; all Grace, Light and Mercy whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever flowing now to the World through him, ever ſince the Fall; <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13, 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19, 20. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>If this Law of the ten Commands were given at the beginning,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34625:4"/>wherefore then was it given at</hi> Sinai <hi>again?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, That the World might the better diſcern their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. and 7.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Secondly, That the rich grace extended by Jeſus Chriſt, might be the better ſeen and eſteemed, and thankfully embraced, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56, 57, 58.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is then the whole World bound to keep this Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea; as appears, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9, to 21. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Wherefore doth</hi> James <hi>call this Law, the Royal Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe this Law is Kingly or Supream; the other Laws of God being inferiour to it in dignity; which, as hand-maids, are given to ſerve this Law, ſince ſin came into the world; which, but for the ſake of, had been altogether uſeleſs. For, what place could there be for the Law of Shadows, but to repreſent a Saviour to come, to redeem us from the Curſe of that Supream Law: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could there be need or uſe of the Law of Judgments to puniſh evil doers, if the Law of the ten Commandments had not been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Doth it appear that Man was created very good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea; as appears, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. and 2.1. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How bad doth Man appear to be now, ſince the Fall?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> So exceeding ſinful, that he of himſelf, if left to himſelf, would do no good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>John</hi> 15.5. nor ſpare no evil, but commit all iniquity with greedineſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.2, 3, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. to 20. Sin having its riſe or ſpring in the nature or heart of man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. and 15.14, 16.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>If all men be by Nature, and of themſelves thus vile, how comes it to paſs that many who are not born again, are yet preſerved from that high degree of abomination, that according to ſome of thoſe fore-named Texts, the heart of man is let out unto?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Men may and are kept from much evil, and carried forth to much good, by the liberal diſtribution of common grace, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by reſtraining grace.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That is thus to be underſtood; When God ordereth Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences ſo, that perſons are prevented and kept by his over-ruling hand from the evils that other-wayes they would do. You have an
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34625:5"/>Inſtance in the preſervation of <hi>David</hi> from <hi>Saul,</hi> when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> Army took off <hi>Saul</hi> by a ſtrong hand from purſuing <hi>Davids</hi> life. And many diſcreet Parents by their good government, and watchful eye over Children, preſerve them from many evils that otherwiſe they would run into. Theſe and other like Providences, by which ſin is prevented, I call reſtraining grace.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVhat call you common grace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That gracious work of the Spirit, by which the generality of men are ordinarily followed and ſtriven with, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may not prevail with multitudes to convert them, yet may it carry them far into a reformation of life, and uſefulneſs to others: The Scripture is full of Inſtances; <hi>Joaſh, Amaziah, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah, Saul, Herod</hi> himſelf, with multitudes moe. Yea, many may go farre, not in Profeſſion only, but ſo high in the Practice of Godlineſs, as to Propheſie and caſt out Devils in Chriſts Name, who never were thorowly converted, yet take themſelves for Converts; but will at laſt be diſappointed; <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVhat proof is there that the Scriptures of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, commonly received to be of Divine Authority, are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is certainly a tried word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.6. and he that will faithfully obey it, ſhall have ſufficient proof of it in ſo doing; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>John</hi> 7.16, 17. See a fuller proof in the forementioned Book.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Of what uſe are the holy Scriptures to us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are of ſuch excellent uſe to us in ſo many reſpects, that it is not eaſie to name; but in general thus. They are the only ſafe Rule of Faith and Life, without any Tradition whatſoever; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſafe direction, and ſuch comfort to the obſervers of them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.32, 33. and 12.30, 31, 32.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Seeing man-kind do receive great benefit by the Mediator, let us underſtand ſomething of his worth by the Scriptures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This Mediator of the New Covenant in the man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. who for the excellency of his perſon, even as he is Man, is the only choice piece in all the workmanſhip of God; and in reſpect of his Spirit or inward Man, the firſt of all the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. which lived in glory with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34625:5"/>God the Father, before any other of his Works had a being; <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22 to 30. <hi>John</hi> 17.5. and was ſent from Heaven to take upon him our nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 16, 17. and in reſpect of his body, fleſh, or outward-man, he was begotten, conceived, and brought forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the moſt high and omnipotent Spirit and a Virgin, without all ſpot or ſtain of ſin; <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Think you he was no more but a creature, although the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of the Creation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I believe if he had been but a meer creature, the work he came for, would have been too hard for him. But he was poſſeſſed, filled, or anointed with the fulneſs of the Godhead, according to the Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3, 9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. See the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Perſon, ſet forth and argued more at large in my Book called, <hi>Means to prevent periſhing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Wherefore was it neceſſary for this moſt excellent Spirit of Chriſt to receive a truly humane body of fleſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. That he might die, according to the Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7, 8, 9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What did his Death effect for us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Our Redemption is effected thereby; <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What ſort of men are redeemed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. All Mankind without exception of any.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Are all effectually redeemed, Believers and unbelievers, alike, without any difference?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yea; believing makes not a man to be ever the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; nor unbelief makes him not to be the leſs redeemed: for that is wrought out by Jeſus Chriſt for all; it dependeth upon the price of his Blood alone whether men believe or not.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Had you not need to prove this point clearly, ſeeing many learned men deny it; As alſo, becauſe it is the great Wheel upon which all the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts and branches of the Gospel turn?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I will therefore lay down theſe fourteen Reaſons to prove it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scripture in ſo many plain poſitive words aſſerteth it; <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17. &amp; 12.47. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is not one Text in the whole Scripture that ſaith he died for no more but Believers, or Elect perſons, Sheep, or the like. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any Text be preſſed to ſerve in that warfare, but what may
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34625:6"/>well be diſcharged of that Service, and yet have a very clear and holy Interpretation allowed it, every way according with Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scriptures ſometimes character or deſcribe the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch names and titles as do not at all agree to Choſen-ones, or Saints, diſtinct from the ungodly world; but they bear theſe names, <hi>Sinners, Ungodly, Enemies, Unjuſt,</hi> Rom. 5.6, 8, 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. and in thoſe Texts mentioned in my firſt Reaſon, they are called <hi>all men,</hi> and <hi>every man,</hi> and <hi>the world,</hi> and <hi>the whole world.</hi> Now theſe can be no meet titles for, or deſcriptions of Redeemed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones, if the Elect diſtinct from the Reprobates were redeemed only.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The work of the Miniſtry is the unworthieſt ſervice that any man can undertake, if all men be not redeemed: for whoever will preach the Goſpel, muſt offer Salvation to Sinners in Chriſts Name, and upon the account of his Death call them to Repentance, and preſs them to believing and an holy Converſation; exhorting them, and if cauſe be, reproving them with all Authority, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. the whole Chapter. But this can no man do to the ſatisfaction of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that doth not believe that they are redeemed, that he thus exhorteth and reproveth: for if his heart ſecretly tell him, Theſe Sinners, how obſtinate ſoever they ſeem to be, can no way help it, nor poſſibly be better, if they be not redeemed, as for ought I know they be not; and if not, then have they more need of pity than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; and if they meet with ſuch as have wit enough to do it, will ſoon tell them ſo, and ſay, How know you that I am redeemed? and if not, which way is it poſſible for me to be better? is there any grace or ſtrength but what is in Chriſt? And if I have no ſhare in his Blood, I can never mend. Your preaching, nor my hearing, without Chriſt's Blood, can never change my heart. This Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can never be anſwered or removed. But the only way both to reſolve doubts, and convince men of their evil ways, is, to prove that Chriſt died for all without exception.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Goſpel, expreſt in the holy Scriptures, is in it ſelf a truth, whoever doth or doth not believe it. Now the Goſpel likewiſe is to be preached unto all, conſidered as men, and as ſinners, without exception, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23, 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. And the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, allowed of God to be preached to the world, is good tydings,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34625:6"/>great joy to all people, peace and good things, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. But nothing of all this Goſpel-grace can have ſincerity and truth in it, with reſpect to any of thoſe men for whom Chriſt died not.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Scriptures declare, that of them Chriſt hath bought, ſome will periſh, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. and if ſo, there is no reaſon to think that any are left without Redemption.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Scripture chargeth the guilt of ſin upon the world for their unbelief, and makes it the true cauſe of their condemnation, <hi>John</hi> 16.9. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. A charge never to be made good, but upon the account that they are Redeemed; for without it they cannot be under the New Covenant, nor the duties of it, which requireth faith in the Lord Jeſus, but muſt needs ſtill remain under the Old Covenant, which requireth not that duty at any mans hand, neither condemneth any man for the want of Faith in him.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The holy Scriptures manifeſt that Chriſt hath obtained by his death, Lordſhip and Dominion over all men, and right of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honour from all men, and power of Judging them for diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Goſpel. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. Now to have a juſt Title and Authority over the men by means of his death, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver died for, is in all reaſon an utter impoſſibility.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Scriptures are moſt expreſs in this Doctrine, that God is no reſpecter of perſons, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. and yet doth he require faith, repentance and obedience at all mens hands, and yet without Chriſt all duties are impoſſible, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. and alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22, 23. and therefore if Chriſt have not died for all men, God muſt needs be of all others the greateſt reſpecter of perſons, which he ſo earneſtly profeſſeth againſt in himſelf, and condemneth in others, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6, 7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Unleſs Chriſt hath died for all men, and by his blood open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a door for the renewing and ſaving of them, it is impoſſible for a multitude of Texts to have any manner of truth in them at all; namely ſuch as do teſtifie his Love to all, his Word and Oath that he would have men repent, and believe, and be ſaved, and not die, nor periſh; he ſaith he hath no pleaſure in it, no not in the death of the wicked, no not of him that doth die; ſaying, <hi>VVhy will you die?</hi> telling men they deſtroy themſelves, and put away eternal life, and turn the grace of God into wantonneſs, tread upon Chriſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34625:7"/>and his blood, and that he would have gathered them, and they would not; and oh that thou hadſt known; with many bowel-like expreſſions not to be numbred. See ſome of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31, 32. <hi>and</hi> 33.11. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. <hi>Jude</hi> 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12, 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. and many more ſpeak the ſ ame language. But it is impoſſible for them to have either truth or ſavour in them, if Chriſt have not died for all men: for there is no means whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that God doth uſe, or that man can uſe, that can do him any good, to work him to repentance or believing, that Chriſt did not die for, or that will ſave him if he could do both.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Both the Scripture and works of God declare him to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in himſelf, and in his nature and diſpoſition enclined to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.15. with much more if need were. But now, if the world generally periſh for want of Redemption, except that little remnant of choſen ones, it is altogether impoſſible that he can be according to this deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Gracious.</hi> But, whereas <hi>James</hi> 2.13. ſaith, <hi>Mercy rejoyceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Judgment;</hi> it would have been much more proper to have ſaid, <hi>Judgment rejoyceth againſt Mercy;</hi> for nothing is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than this, that God ſaveth no man but upon ſuch tearms as do moſt abundantly maintain the honour of his Juſtice; and if in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning men he have not the ſame reſpect to the honour of his Mercy, which cannot be without Redemption, how is it poſſible that his Mercy ſhould be commenſurable to his Severity, much leſs can it rejoyce againſt it; therefore it is evident all are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Seeing it is plain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22. that by virtue of Chriſts coming all men riſe from the dead, he certainly hath redeemed them, or elſe he came purpoſely to bring upon them that eternal miſery which without him could never have befallen them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that deny Univerſal Redemption, render Chriſt more a Deſtroyer of mankind than a Saviour of them, contrary to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.56. <hi>John</hi> 12.47.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The innocency and profitableneſs of this Doctrine ſpeaks for the truth of it; for as it agrees with the Atributes of God in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſo it doth not degrade him of his power, but it tendeth to ſhew that he will not uſe it unwiſely nor cruelly: and as it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34625:7"/>to encourage Faith, and ſo Godlineſs in all, ſo it no way miniſtreth any occaſion or temptation to ſin; but rather it tells men that if they go on to ſin and periſh, it is their own fault altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The contrary Doctrine manifeſtly tends to work doubts in mens minds, whether they be Redeemed or no; and ſo reckoneth their Faith, and ſo their Godlineſs the fruit of Faith.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Hath not Chriſt by Redemption purchaſed eternal life for all the Redeemed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea; in ſuch a ſence as God gave <hi>David Sauls</hi> Houſe, and his Wives, for if he had liked to ahve had them, nothing ſtood in the way to hinder him, but in no other ſenſe; for Redemption is not Salvation, although it be a ſufficient means to effect it, yet doth it not put any man into an abſolute right thereof, but a man without any diſhonour to the work of Redemption may miſs thereof.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is Redemption then, and how may it be underſtood?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is an abſolute purchaſing of us by the price of his own blood, from under the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. to himſelf; as appears from the ſeventh and eighth Reaſons going before; and ſo hath brought us under the New Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20, 29. which is eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. than the Old was.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVhat are the tearms, conditions or promiſes pertaining to the Old Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Theſe for ſubſtance are all the tearms of that firſt Covenant, <hi>The man that doth theſe things ſhall live by them:</hi> And, <hi>Curſed is he that doth them not,</hi> Rom. 10.5. Gal. 3.10, 12.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVhat are the promiſes or tearms of the New Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt in brief, theſe are the New Covenant tearms; <hi>He that believes, ſhall be ſaved; and he that believeth not, ſhall be condemned.</hi> But ſecondly, The whole revelation of the Lords divine pleaſure, expreſt in the Promiſes and Threatnings of the Scriptures, are the New Covenant Tearms; thoſe only excepted that before were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, appertaining to the Firſt Covenant.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But what is the New Covenant it ſelf, or how may it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Chriſt himſelf is ſaid to be given as the Covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. and 49.8. Secondly, the Blood of Chriſt is called, <hi>the Covenant,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:34625:8"/>or <hi>Teſtament, Mat.</hi> 26.28. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. Thirdly, Teaching mercy, pardoning mercy, and renewing mercy, are called the Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10., 11, 12. From all which this is evident, That the New Covenant is Free Grace, not only tendred, but extended by the Father through the blood of the Son to all men, ſufficient to enable them to believe acceptably; and they that believe, have eternal life given them, and all that tends to fit them for that bleſſed inheritance, while the obſtinate unbelievers for their diſobedience to the Goſpel of Grace periſh.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is Faith of neceſſity to this New Covenant benefit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea; in all come up to years of diſcretion, and capeable to attain it; as appears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6, 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22, 26. <hi>John</hi> 3.15, 16, 18, 36.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Have Children no Faith, ſuppoſe you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We have no reaſon to believe they have, or can have any, ſeeing Faith comes by hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 17. and there can be no reaſon to believe, that Faith can poſſibly be raiſed in the ſoul without hearing, or means equivolent to bearing, ſufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the underſtanding in the knowledge of the Truth.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Do you believe Children are ſaved although they have no Faith, ſeeing the Lord will not ſave perſons of underſtanding without it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea; Firſt, becauſe Chriſt tels us, that <hi>Of ſuch is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 19.13, 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. Secondly, They being redeemed, and ſo delivered from all danger of eternal ruine, upon the Old Covenant account; It is no way likely that the New Covenant, which is better and more merciful, will ever condemn ſuch as never live to diſobey it; alſo the Scripture plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſteth that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> brought a Cure every way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Diſeaſe the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> brought upon the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the grace is much more abundant that comes by him: which being true, there is no place for a doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the eſtate of Infants, but that it is well with them, ſeeing they have no more diſeaſe but what hath originally befallen them, if Children have no Faith.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVhat then is a viſible Church of Chriſt, or how may it be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from other Aſſemblies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The viſible Church of Chriſt, is an Aſſembly of faithful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Saints by calling at leaſt.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:34625:8"/>
            <p> Q. <hi>VVho are Saints by calling?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Thoſe that are won by the Goſpel to believe, and voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give up themſelves to the profeſſion and practice of Religion and Godlineſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVhat Ordinances hath Chriſt appointed in his Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Prayer, Preaching, Baptiſm, Laying on of Hands, the Lords Supper, with all Duties of Love in general, and when neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, Excommunication alſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6, 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>John</hi> 13.14, 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17.18.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>At what age ought perſons to be Baptized, and received into Church-Communion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The Scriptures have not expreſt any age, but the time when perſons do indeed repent, and with all the heart believe the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.36, 37, 38. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 41, 42. and ſo ſaith the Common-Prayer-Book alſo in its Catechiſme, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Be thoſe that are Baptized, and ſo Members of the viſible Church, Heirs of Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yea; if they do, as they profeſs, in truth believe, <hi>John.</hi> 3.15. &amp; 16.36.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVhat is true Faith, let us underſtand and know it, ſeeing it is ſo neceſſary to Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. True Faith believes unfainedly all that God ſaith, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely ſoever it appears to ſenſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6, 7, 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.45.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVhat is the nature of true Faith, or how may it be known when it is ſavingly wrought in the heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It will work men to a ſuitable obedience, and deliver them from the love and ſervice of ſin; and therfore if any do live in the ſervice of known ſin, they cannot be in the Faith, nor yet the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 8.34, 39. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVill not that Faith then juſtifie men, which is without good works?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. No, it cannot, becauſe it is fruitleſs and dead, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:34625:9"/>
            <p> Q. <hi>Are we juſtified by Faith, or by VVorks, or by both together?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Nay; we are juſtified by Faith without Works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20; 27, 28. <hi>and</hi> 4.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For however the Faith that is without Works will not juſtifie, yet the Works themſelves add nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our juſtification.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVherefore then are good VVorks of neceſſity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. They are not at all of neceſſity to juſtifie us, nevertheleſs if we be without them, our Faith is not true nor living, no more than he can be a living man that hath no breath in his noſtrils.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But are VVorks of no uſe but only to prove our Faith true and of a living nature?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes; we may and muſt work diligently, as well as believe in order to the attainment of our Sanctification, which is as neceſſary to Salvation as Juſtification is; and Holineſs is not gotten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diligent working, <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVherefore muſt we work in order to our growth in Holineſs, and not in order to our Juſtification?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. In the one works profit not, but contrarily tend to rob the Lord of the honour of his grace, who forgiveth freely iniquity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. but in the other works are profitable for the attaining of holineſs, as was ſhewed before; and they are profitable to men, and honourable to God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8, 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But then wherefore muſt we believe in order to Sanctification, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it will not prevent working?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. All Works are altogether vain without grace and bleſſing from God, which muſt be fetched by Faith from him through Chriſt, that we may be kept humble in working, and withall thankful for what we obtain through believing.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How ought we to exerciſe our Faith, that we may become Saints? or are we adopted without it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. No, not without it, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. but thus ought we to exerciſe our Faith. Firſt, conſider the Might, Grace, Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs of God; and hence conclude that you may well believe his words be all true. Secondly, conſider the clearneſs of the Goſpel held forth to ſinners, loſt and helpleſs in themſelves, yet may ſcarcely reſt upon the grace of God in Chriſt,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34625:9"/>for grace to change the heart and life, according to the promiſes made to ſuch in the Goſpel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. with many like gracious promiſes in the Scripture; and through the beholding the glory of the Lord in his Goſpel, thou ſhalt not only be adopted, but alſo changed by the Spirit of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>When a perſon is a Child of God by Faith, is there any thing more for him to do in order to his enjoying eternal happineſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea; it is his duty, and that in order to his ſafety, to live by Faith, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is there eminent danger of a Believers falling away?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There is danger, if a man be careleſs and decline; but no ſuch eminent danger, but that he who is in the Faith, may very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly and well continue therein, <hi>John</hi> 15.9, 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.43. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How comes it to paſs that any do or may fall away? Doth the Lord leave them to temptation and danger, or comes it to paſs through ſome wilful diſobedience of their own?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Their own ungodly turning aſide muſt needs be the alone cauſe thereof; for the Lord on his part never fails to do all that is meet for him to do, or that can honourably be done by him, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from falling, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23, 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Do you think then that the Lord doth not ſave ſome men by an om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent arm? ſeeing,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. ſaith, <hi>That they are kept by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God to ſalvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Compare that Text with <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. and you may ſee he means no more, but the Goſpel faithfully believed is Gods power to ſave men; and he that ſo continueth is ſafe enough, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But if men do fall from the Faith, may they not be recovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to repentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea doubtleſs, if they fall not into the blaſphemy of the holy Spirit, they may; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.5. but it is a very dangerous ſinful eſtate, and a recovery out of it harder than the firſt converſion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But how doth it appear, that any that do in truth believe with ſuch a Faith, as, if they had continued in, would have ſaved them, may finally fall away and periſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:34625:10"/>
            <p> A. It appeareth plainly from the expreſs teſtimony of the holy Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, 26, <hi>and</hi> 33.12, 13, 18. <hi>John</hi> 15.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Do you think that all that fall away are ſuch as once truly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſhould have been ſaved, if they had continued in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. No by no means; for when men do fall off from the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Godlineſs, eſpecially in great numbers, it is like they were never ſound, <hi>John</hi> 6.60, 66. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. For, I believe it is not eaſie nor ordinary for a true Believer to come to fall from the Faith, eſpecially ſo low as from the profeſſion of it; but contrarily many that are not ſound, may ſtand in their profeſſion to the laſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But is it not poſſible for a true Believer to ſecure both himſelf and his fears from the danger of falling away?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yea, very well; God affords rich ſupplies of grace for that end, and he that takes the direction the Scripture giveth, ſhall be ſure he ſhall never fall from the Faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>and</hi> 3.17, 18. and he that perſevereth in the Faith to the end, ſhall never miſs of eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 5.24. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.22, 23.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How comes a People to be a Church, or what Miniſtry is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to put them in Order, and make them meet to partake of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Chriſt and his holy Spirit, by the infallible Miniſtry of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>You ſpeak as if men might put themſelves into a Church Order and Fellowſhip, do you think they may or can do it warrantably?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. No; I know it is impoſſible for men to make themſelves an acceptable or a holy Church, neither do men go about it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they are directed by the holy Scriptures in this work; but they are without doubt upon the Apoſtles and Prophets truly built, and Chriſt is the true corner-ſtone of the Building, and the holy Spirit the Builder: But if any men ſhould come and ſay, they are Apoſtles, and ſhould alſo work Miracles, yet ought we not to leave the holy Scriptures one hairs breadth to follow them; the true Foundation is laid already, and no man can lay any other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. and we have Chriſt and his Apoſtles indeed in the New Teſtament, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. and <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34625:10"/>Old, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29, 31. all which are a full and perfect guide to every good work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Hath not Chriſt appointed a continuing Miniſtry to feed and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yea; we are inſtructed what their work or office and their qualifications muſt be, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But how ſhall men come by a power orderly to make or to be made Miniſters now ſince the apoſtacy, ſeeing there is not a ſucceſſion of that true Miniſtry to ordain as Chriſt left?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Firſt, it is Chriſt and not men that makes Miniſters; if we had now the Churches the Apoſtles planted, and the Biſhops they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, they could give him no lawful power to miniſter the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel that Chriſt hath not fitted for that work by his Spirit; neither ſee I any reaſon to doubt of the lawfulneſs of his exerciſe of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry that Chriſt hath fitted for that work: Gifts to men for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and gifts of Miniſters to the Church, are both from him, <hi>Ephſ.</hi> 4.7, 8, 11, 12. therefore his Miniſters and his Churches muſt take heed to his Word, which is a ſafe and ſure guide to them in all caſes. It is beyond doubt that Churches may, and ought to elect or chooſe their Miniſters, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. which plainly ſheweth that they are competent Judges of their fitneſs for the ſervice they are to undertake; and as for laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, I can ſee no more but theſe two ends of it; One to ſeek the Lords bleſſing and further aſſiſtance of the Spirit upon their Miniſtry, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end to manifeſt their approbation of what Chriſt hath done in fitting of them for that work; and what they do, ſeems to me to be done as Servants for the Church, and not by virtue of any power or authority that is placed in any Officer or company of Miniſters whatſoever, to give him lawful power to Officiate as a Miniſter of Chriſt, that otherwiſe wanted a lawful authority ſo to do. My Reaſons are,</p>
            <p>Firſt, I find hands laid on them that neither wanted an Office, nor a ſufficient Call to the exerciſe of it, upon their ſetting forth from the Church to preach the Goſpel abroad in the world, <hi>Acts,</hi> 12.3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I find that whoſe hath gifts to Preach, may lawfully uſe them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. and yet this ſeems to be the greateſt work of an Apoſtle of Chriſt. Compare 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14, 17. with 9.16,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34625:11"/>17. And I can find no warrant for Churches or Miniſters to commit a Paſtoral charge to any man, but ſuch an one as is a known, apt, and able Preacher, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9. which cannot well be, except he be frequently found in the work of Preaching; and therefore my judgement is, that the work of the Miniſtry is not bound to a Miniſter, although a Miniſter be bound to his work, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>You ſaid a little before, that Baptiſm belonged to ſuch as believe and repent: Let us underſtand what that Ordinance is, and wherein it will profit us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It is a Burial in Water, in the Name of the Father, Son, &amp; Holy Spirit; to ſignifie Death, Burial, and Reſurrection, that as Chriſt died for us and roſe from the Grave, ſo we that believe ſhall riſe by means of his Death to inherit eternal life, and ſhall receive grace through his Death to kill ſin, and quicken us to walk in newneſs of life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Since you ſay Believers ſhall riſe to inherit eternal Life, ſhall no others riſe from the grave again?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yea; although all ſhall not riſe to glory, yet Chriſt having Redeemed them from the Curſe of the Law, it is impoſſible the Grave can detain them for ever; but firſt or laſt both good and bad ſhall riſe again, <hi>John</hi> 5.28, 29. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Do not all the dead, good and bad, riſe at once?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. No; the faithful riſe to enjoy a glorious Kingdom with Chriſt a thouſand years, before the wicked world ſhall riſe again, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.3, 4, 5, 6. yet ſhall they at laſt riſe to receive the ſentence of condemnation, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>John</hi> 5.29.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What think you of the Spirit or Inward-man? Doth that more excellent part die with the Body, or what ſtate is it in till the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. What its injoyments are, or in what place or places their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits remain, I ſhall not ſay; and I would no man would ſay more in the caſe than he can clearly prove, to raiſe fruitleſs contention; but this much is clear, That the Spirits of men do live when the Body is dead, and are capable of enjoying more communion with Chriſt than while they remained in the Body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, 8, 9. <hi>and</hi> 12.2, 3, 4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.30, 31. and what I have ſeen urged to the contrary, wants ſtrength and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34625:11"/>but Controverſie becomes not a Catechiſm.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is the Spirit taken out of the Body to the eſtate it ſhall for ever remain in, as ſome think, and the Body never riſe out of the duſt again?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Although the fore-named Texts be full of authority, to prove, that that very Body that dies, and is laid in the duſt, ſhall riſe again; yet I for a further proof commend to conſideration 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Job</hi> 19.25, 26, 27. Theſe places can admit of no other Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Will you ſpeak to the Ordinance of Laying on of Hands, in what caſes it is appointed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It ſeems to me to be appointed in ſeveral caſes; Firſt, for the bleſſing of the Lord on Church Members for the gifts and increaſe of the Spirit, that they may grow uſeful in and to the Body, the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>and</hi> 19.2, 6, 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. and 1.12. And being reckoned among the Principles, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. I cannot ſee but Principles of Religion muſt belong to all that are Religious.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But thoſe Texts in the Acts ſpeak of the gift of Tongues given by this Ordinance; Is it to be practiſed for that end?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Hands are to be laid on for what Gifts it pleaſeth the Holy Spirit to give, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. for however it pleaſed the Lord to give thoſe gifts that were more than ordinary, in the uſe of it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in that day, yet it ſeems to be more the deſign of the Lord, for the advancement of the Goſpel in that day, than the end of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and the Gift might exceed the expectation of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator, or the Receiver, its like, if we conſider 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6, 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and 14, <hi>Chapters.</hi> It can no more be proved that it was appointed for ſuch an end, than it can be proved that Preaching the Goſpel was appointed for that end; yet it pleaſed the Lord to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as far in the one of thoſe Ordinances, as in the other of them, in that day, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.46. But if there be any ground to expect thoſe gifts that are more than ordinary in the uſe of any means or duties incumbant upon us, it may rather be expected from Believing, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or Baptiſm, than from Laying on of Hands, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17, 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>In what other caſes is this Ordinance appointed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. In the ſetting apart Church Officers to their Miniſtry, for the further aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, to ſupply them with help for the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34625:12"/>diſcharge of their great work, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. as likewiſe for healing the ſick, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.18. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.8, 9.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But is it not appointed for Children likewiſe, that they may receive a bleſſing from Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I cannot ſay there is any appointment by way of command for it to them, if our Lords example, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.13, 14, 15. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.13, 14, 15, 16. be not a ſufficient warrant to his Miniſters to bleſs in his Name, as his Miniſters of old did, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23, to 27. There is no other warrant that I know of; I ſhall therefore leave it to conſideration.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But is there not an Ordinance of Annointing appointed for the ſick Members of the Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yea; and the manner directed, and precious Promiſes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the upright and faithful performance of that duty, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the right manner of receiving the Lords Supper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The worſt of men do acknowledge that the perſons receiving muſt be qualified with Faith and Repentance, thankfulneſs to God, and charity to men; I need not prove that: Let not ſuch men as confeſs that, riſe up in judgement againſt us: But what I ſhall ſay, is to the time, which is plainly ſignified to be at night, after our own ſupper is lovingly eaten together; and therefore are they reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that are their own ſupper before their poor brethren came to eat with them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.21, 22, 23, 24, 25. and are commanded for after-times not to do ſo, but to tarry one for another, <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. there is no warrant from Chriſt or his Apoſtles for any other ſeaſon; but it is eaſie for good men to learn of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> to carry the Ark upon a Cart.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>You ſeem to ſpeak as if nothing might be done, neither for matter nor manner, but according to direction from the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It is true, it is my Faith; we are not wiſe enough to guide our ſelves, nor any men by humane wiſdom fit to guide us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt not pin our Faith upon any of their ſleeves, nor follow them but as they follow Chriſt; the written Word is the alone rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But will this Rule hold good in all caſes, temporal as well as ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, buying and ſelling, governing and being governed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I know not the caſe in which it will not hold, for the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34625:12"/>are able thorowly to furniſh a man for every good work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17. and a King is bound by the expreſs Law of God to have a Copy of the Law of God by him, ſo to direct him in his whole du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he turn not from Gods Commandment, neither to the right hand nor to the left, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19, 20. and ſo likewiſe muſt every inferiour perſon know how to diſcharge his duty by the direction of the ſame word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.7, 8. for a mans obedience, where the Law of Nature moſt binds him, is to be but in the Lord, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.1. the which duties can never be regularly performed but by the knowledge of the will of God, which whoſoever will attain, muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint himſelf with the Word of Truth, the holy Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. and 105.130.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the duty of Prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, To ask according to the Will of God. Secondly, Take heed that you have no iniquity in your hands, nor the love of it in your hearts; but ſee that they be purged from all deſigne of ſerving it, if you would be heard. Thirdly, Be ſure to go with a merciful forgiving heart. Fourthly, Pray frequently, and ceaſe not till an anſwer comes. Fifthly, Believe or reſt upon the Almighties grace, and compaſſion through Chriſt, for to hear and anſwer you, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12, 14, 15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1, to 9. <hi>John</hi> 16.23, 24. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Who are to be caſt out of the Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Obſtinate and ſcandalous ſinners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Are ſuch to be received into the Church again or not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes; they are to be received again with all love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if they repent, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is Repentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is an unfained turning from all ungodlineſs and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, in all things to pleaſe the Lord.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Doth not Repentance conſiſt in great ſorrow and humblings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> So much ſorrow and humiliation is neceſſary as will bring our hearts to ſearch out the Will of God and do it; for that is the great end and uſe of godly ſorrow, to work the heart to that hatred of ſin, and that watchfulneſs, care, and ſence of the evil of it, and danger of falling into it, that we may be preſerved from it for time to come,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34625:13"/>and have our hearts and wayes brought into a ſincere obedience and conformity to the will of God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Will you now before you conclude, give your ſence of God, and of his wayes, how we are to judge of him and them, according as was hinted in the beginning? Make thoſe things plain, for in thoſe general tearms all men will ſubſcribe to what you ſay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. My meaning is, That whatſoever the Scriptures do attribute to God, which holdeth forth excellency and glory, as theſe, Power, Juſtice, Holineſs, Wiſdom, Knowledge, Truth or Faithfulneſs, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, Eternity, Infiniteneſs, Omnipreſence, Omniſciencie, or the like; they are to be underſtood to be ſo perfectly the nature and being of God, or which is all one, they bear ſo perfect an accord with his matchleſs being and goodneſs, that he can neither decree nor act at any time contrary unto them; but what ever he decreeth or doth, bears a perfect accord with theſe glorious Attributes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But when any thing is ſpoken of him which argueth frailty, or imperfection, theſe muſt be underſtood with great caution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction; as namely, Wrath, Hatred, Repentance, or any paſſage that implieth want of Knowledge, theſe cannot be properly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God at any time, but do or muſt refer, or be referred to ſome works that God doth, that have ſome circumſtances at leaſt in them, either for matter or manner, which if done by man would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue evil, weakneſs, or imperfection in him, but impoſſible it is that they can proceed from imperfection in God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Do you call Repentance imperfection? is it not a fruit of grace and a good work to Repent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Although it be good and neceſſary for man to repent, yet it argueth imperfection in him; for if he had done nothing amiſs, he need not nor ought not to repent: but for the Lord, he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is evil, and therefore need not nor cannot repent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. and any word implying any ſuch weakneſs in God, is ſpoken for our ſakes, the Lord ſtooping down to our infirmity, that we may the better underſtand him.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What think you of Gods Decrees?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Firſt, I believe them to be in Gods purpoſe determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his infinite Wiſdom and Counſel, before the world began, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5, 9, 11. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. And ſecondly, I believe them to be as unalterable as God himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:34625:13"/>
            <p> Q. <hi>Think you we may not go too far in ſearching into the Decrees of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yea doubtleſs, if we go farther than the Scriptures have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his mind, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. But for his Decrees or Purpoſes, which are all one, of Election, Reprobation, Salvation and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, theſe are parts of his Revealed Counſel, and may be looked into, and muſt, if we muſt look into the Myſteries of the Goſpel; for certain it is, that he doth nothing in time, nor ſaith any thing in his Word, but what beareth a perfect accord with his eternal and unchangable Decrees. The Promiſes of the Goſpel do tell us who are Elected to Salvation, and the Threatnings do likewiſe tell us who are Reprobated to Deſtruction; for God doth not Reprobate one ſort of men and Threaten another, nor Threaten one ſort and Puniſh another.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Who are elected to Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Thoſe that in truth believe, and are truly ſanctified by the Spirit, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Are perſons choſen and made Believers, becauſe they were choſen firſt? or being found in a ſtate of believing, are they, as ſuch, choſen to Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I know no Text of Scripture that ſaith that any are choſen any other wayes than they are in Chriſt, Believers, Saints, or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or fore-ſeen ſo to be, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But are not perſons made Believers by grace? or hath any man more than is freely wrought in him by the Spirit of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. No man is more or can be better than the Spirit of grace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him; yet doth it not follow hence, that grace is conferred on any man partially or irreſiſtably, or that any unbelievers do want ſufficient ſupplies of the Spirit of Grace to inable them to believe, as hath before been proved.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Who are Reprobated to deſtruction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Such as turn the Grace of God into wantonneſs, remaining in unbelief when the truth is made known to them; reſiſting it for want of love to it; not ſuffering Chriſt to dwell in their hearts by Faith, but treading on him through the love of iniquity, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19. Theſe Texts with many others, do declare that ſuch men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, and for ſuch cauſes only.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But where the Spirit of grace is extended, it is able to cure the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34625:14"/>ſouls of men of theſe ſins and corruptions is it not, ſo that they ſhall not periſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is ſo, and it will and doth cure them that receive him; but he neither wil nor doth cure thoſe that continue to reſiſt him, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates do to their own deſtruction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is there any profit in the knowledge of the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea, great advantage; for he that continueth in Chriſt by unfained believing, is under the Promiſes of Election and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cannot poſſibly miſs thereof, <hi>John</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>John</hi> 15.24. Secondly, In a ſtate of unbelief and diſobedience to the Goſpel who ever is found, is under the threatnings of Reprobation and condemnation, and cannot poſſibly miſs thereof, <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19, 36. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.3, 5, 6. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8, 9. Now the knowledge of this is a bleſſed means to encourage and quicken men to believing and holineſs.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is not then the free grace of God the principal cauſe of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes; unqueſtionably the free grace and love of God is the original cauſe of Redemption as well as of Election; and likewiſe of all the mercy the Sons of men are made partakers of in one kind or other from firſt to laſt; for there is nothing in the Creature that can be a cauſe to move God to be merciful, if his own infinite com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions did not incline him to extend grace and favour to poor fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; yet will he extend his mercies upon us, by ſuch means, and upon ſuch tearms as ſhall wholly agree with his own holy will and honour, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, 7. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 10.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is not the foundation of God ſure? the Lord knoweth them that be his, and ſo conſequently them that are not his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea it is beyond all doubt, that there is no counſel, thing, nor thought, but it is perfectly fore-known to God; yet will it by no means follow, that his fore-knowledge of any thing is the cauſe wherefore it cometh to paſs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.21.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVill the Lord give grace to ſave ſuch men as he fore-knoweth will abuſe it and periſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea, and that to ſo great a degree as might well prevent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34625:14"/>their deſtruction, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.14, 15, 16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10, 11. with many moe Texts of like import.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>VVherefore doth the all-wiſe God do ſo, ſeeing he knoweth it will do them no good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. For many reaſons, but eſpecially theſe two. Firſt, his own rich mercy is, and will, by this means be exalted ſo high, that they and all men ſhall one day know, that his tender mercies would have prevented their ruine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.32. And ſecondly, That when they do come to periſh, they may be altogether left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>John</hi> 15.22.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Seeing theſe are the Counſels and VVayes of the moſt High, what concerns me to believe and do, that I may be found in a ſtate of acceptation before him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It eminently and in the firſt place concerns thee, in all plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, to ſearch out the clear knowledge of his holy will in all things, and firmly to believe the ſame; for ſuch a ſincere Faith will intereſt thee into a ſtate of acceptation with God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.8, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. Secondly, Live by Faith, to bring forth the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereof; and in this path thou canſt not miſs of Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Open this Life of Faith with clearneſs in ſome main and principal points, for the ſafe direction of the ſoul in this path of peace and happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Carry the Truths of God ſo upon thy heart, that thy whole converſation may comport or agree with thy Faith; as for example, Conſider God is in himſelf good and faithful, and therefore all his words are ſo alſo: however carnal ſence may preſent them, yet are they of a moſt divine quality, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.127, 128, 138, 140. All his Commandments are good, and given for our good, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.165. And mind alwayes, that every ſaying of his is moſt true, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.6, 7, 8. Therefore when he threatneth ſinners, he certainly intendeth their deſtruction unleſs they take warning and repent; and upon ſuch tearms as he hath promiſed to be gracious, he will never diſappoint the hopes of any man; and when he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to the uſe of any means, he meaneth to bleſs that means, if we uſe it for our ſaving good; and when he calleth us to come unto him for any favour, he intendeth the beſtowing of it upon us, if we come to him for it: neither calleth he us at any time to any work, but what he meaneth to aſſiſt us in the doing of; no nor yet to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34625:15"/>for Him or his Truth, but with an intention to afford us grace and ſtrength to bear us up under them, as alſo to ſanctifie them to us for good, and to deliver us in the beſt ſeaſon. Therefore if thou wilt live by Faith, lay up theſe and ſuch like truths in thy heart, to quicken thee to watch and pray, to reſiſt ſin and fly ſnares. And in all thy godly endeavours, exerciſe Faith in and upon the rich Grace of God, through the blood of Chriſt, for thoſe ſupplies of grace which are needful to mend thy heart and life daily. And if thou run this race humbly, faithfully and diligently, thou mayeſt be as ſure as thou art of thy being, to arrive at laſt at that Haven of felicity and eternal peace, where no ſin, temptation or ſorrow ſhall ever come to moleſt or trouble thee more: But if thou prize the pleaſures of ſin, thy intereſt or credit with men, thy eaſe or peace in the world, ſo high, as theſe things thou wilt not loſe or hazard for Chriſt, or his Kingdom and the righteouſneſs thereof; then know that that Lake of fire and brimſtone will be thy portion at laſt, from whence there is no redemption; <hi>And from which the good Lord deliver us,</hi> Amen.</p>
